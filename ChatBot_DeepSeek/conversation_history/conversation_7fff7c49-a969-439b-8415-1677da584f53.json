      "thinking": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why my Mac is showing that I have 70GB of documents but when I search, I can't find that much. I'm using a MacBook Pro M3 and I'm not sure where those files are hiding.\n\nFirst, I think about what \"docs\" could mean. Maybe it's referring to all types of files, not just text documents. So perhaps it includes images, videos, music, etc., but the term \"docs\" is a bit vague.\n\nI remember that macOS has different places where files can be stored. The main ones are the Documents folder in my user directory, which is usually on the desktop, and maybe other locations like Downloads or the root of the startup disk. But I could have moved some files to other folders or used external drives.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the system is counting hidden files or those in system directories that I can't see normally. Hidden files are sometimes where applications store their data, which might be contributing to the size without me knowing about it.\n\nI also use cloud storage services like iCloud and Google Drive. It's possible that some of these 70GB are stored there but the Mac is still counting them as local files because they're synced. I should check if my settings show where these files are actually being stored—on my Mac or in the cloud.\n\nTime Machine could be another culprit. If I have a backup, maybe it's including those backups in the file count, but I thought Time Machine was separate and wouldn't affect the current disk space.\n\nI might also have some duplicate files that I'm not aware of. Over time, it's easy to save multiple copies of the same document without realizing it, which could add up quickly.\n\nTo get a clear picture, I should open Finder and look at the \"Finder\" menu options for more detailed information. Maybe using Cmd + Opt + Esc to see all processes or looking into Activity Monitor to check if any apps are holding onto file handles, causing them not to be fully released.\n\nI can also try the \"Show All Files\" feature in Finder by pressing Cmd + Shift + . to reveal hidden files and folders. That might show me some unexpected storage locations.\n\nGoing through each suggested step systematically: checking the specific folder sizes, looking at cloud storage settings, verifying Time Machine, searching for duplicates with a tool like Duplicate Cleaner, emptying the Trash, managing app support files, examining login items, using OnyX for disk repair, and analyzing logs. Each of these steps could help pinpoint where those 70GB are hiding.\n\nI should also consider that sometimes apps can cache data or store temporary files which accumulate over time. Maybe clearing out caches and temp files would free up some space.\n\nOverall, it's a process of elimination. I'll start with the easiest checks—like checking my Downloads folder—and move on to more technical steps if needed. Hopefully, one of these methods will show where those 70GB are stored so I can manage them appropriately.\n"
